# Olive Tree Detection in Puglia, Italy using YOLO11n and RGB VHR aerial imagery.

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for large-scale olive tree detection in Puglia (Southern Italy) featuring:
 ## YOLO11n Customized Model
 - YOLO11n model training on 0.2m-resolution aerial imagery from AGEA (Agenzia Erogazioni in Agricoltura, ndr.)
## Parallelized Large-Area Inference
 - Distributed processing of 1TB+ imagery via ThreadPoolExecutor
 - Grid-based analysis using 1024Ã—1024 px tiles (â‰ˆ200mÃ—200m at 0.2m/px)
 - On-the-fly WMS image retrieval â†’ detection â†’ automatic cleanup workflow
 - Output: Georeferenced shapefiles per tile with confidence scores
 - Fast Inference: 24 hour processing time for the whole Apulia region on a NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB (total area 20,000 Km^2)
## Spatial Data Consolidation
 - High-performance merging of tile predictions into unified regional shapefiles consisting of 50M olive trees.
 - Topology-preserving aggregation for seamless polygon boundaries (in the works).
 - Memory-efficient processing chain for potential national-scale deployment

The methodology has been successfully tested in the BAT (Barletta-Andria-Trani) and northern Bari areas, but it currently shows limitations in Foggia and Salento due to insufficient training data representation.

Technical Details
- Spatial resolution: 0.2m/px (commercial satellite data)
- Tile size: 1024Ã—1024 px (â‰ˆ200mÃ—200m)
- Model: Custom-trained YOLO11n
- Performance (BAT area):
    - Precision: 93%
    - Recall: 89%
    - mAP@0.5: 93%
    - R^2 : 0.90
    - Median Absolute Error: 11.4 Trees per Hectare

## Known Limitations
Performance degradation occurs in: (1) Foggia/Salento regions (limited training samples), (2) densely vegetated areas (false positives), and (3) Xylella-infected zones where canopy damage complicates detection.
